Provide detailed explanations and best practices for each alert created.
You always have to worry about getting the PromQL formatted correctly in markdown.

## Details to Include:

1. **Tool-Specific Guidance:** Offer tailored advice for each tool (e.g., Kubernetes, EC2).

3. **Accuracy and Relevance:** The alerts should be precise and applicable to common issues.
4. **Explanations and Best Practices:** Include clear explanations and recommended practices.
5. **Explanation about metrics:** Explain the purpose of each metric used in the alert.
